# Polygon Advanced Module 1

This project, Polygon Advanced Module 1, focuses on deploying an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, mapping the collection to Polygon, and transferring assets via the Polygon Bridge.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download the project by cloning the entire repository. This will give you access to all the contents of the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Polygon-Advanced-Module-1` project directory and install dependencies using the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Deploying the ERC721 Contract

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and provide your wallet private key where required (i.e., `PRIVATE_KEY= 'your wallet private key'`).
2. Deploy the ERC721 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet using the following command:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 
   ```

   **Note:** After deploying, copy the generated contract address into `contractAddress.js` (in the metadata folder) and `batchMint.js` (in the scripts folder).

### Batch Mint NFTs

1. To batch-mint NFTs, use the deployed ERC721 contract with the following command:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat run scripts/batchMint.js --network goerli
   ```

   This script mints a specified number of NFTs and assigns them to your address.

### Approve and Deposit NFTs to Polygon Mumbai

1. Approve and deposit the minted NFTs from Ethereum to the Polygon Mumbai network via the FxPortal Bridge using the following command:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat run scripts/approveDeposit.js --network goerli
   ```
